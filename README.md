# UNO-ASCII

### An ASCII-based version of UNO, made as a CPT for Grade 11 CS. Features a version of the 'Stacking' rule, and functions just like UNO would if you were playing either the card game or the video-game version. Created by both me and another classmate.

Features of Program - 

Website: A simple website to assist the user with any general 
information regarding UNO.

Title Screen: Display the UNO text and the options for the menu.
	
Jump-In: The ‘Jump-In’ rule has been added to this version of
	the game. If the user has a card that is the same number
	as the card in the top of the deck, they can play it.

Stacking: The ‘Stacking’ rule has been added to this version of the game.
	 If the user has played a card example ‘R3’, the game will follow up
	 and ask the user if they want to play a corresponding card based on
	 the number, provided the user has that card in their deck.

Shuffling: The deck once generated is shuffled and the first 14 cards are
	 distributed to the computer and user and then deleted.

Deck Generation / Reshuffle: When the game runs out of cards in the main deck,
	 the deck gets regenerated.

Cards: The cards are represented as actual playing cards you may find at your 
	local store which helps make the game more realistic. 

CPU: Intelligent-like choices such that the computer does not play cards it
	does not have, the computer also changes the colors when played a 
	plus 4 or wild card (color change).

Restrictions – None.
